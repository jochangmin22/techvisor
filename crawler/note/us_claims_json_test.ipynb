      "What is claimed is:    1. A unidirectional ratchet wrench comprising: a head having a drive member for applying torque to a workpiece;  a rotatable gear disposed in the head and having gear teeth;  a bidirectional pawl disposed in the head in a first operating condition in which the pawl is pivotally engageable with the gear to allow torque-applying rotation of the gear with the head in a first direction;  a bias member adjacent the pawl to allow ratcheting rotation of the head relative to the gear in a second direction, wherein the first operating condition also includes the ratcheting rotation; and  an obstruction disposed within the head for engagement with the pawl to prevent the pawl from moving from the first operating condition to a second operating condition in which the pawl may allow ratcheting rotation of the head relative to the gear in the first direction.    2.
